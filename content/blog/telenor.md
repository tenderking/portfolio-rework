# My Experience at Telenor - A Journey as a Platform Developer

I recently started my journey at Telenor as a platform developer and I've learned so much during this time. The past few months have been a great learning experience for me, both professionally and personally.

I had been learning frontend development on my own before joining Telenor and I was able to use much of what I learned in my role as a platform developer. Working with Git, pair programming, and pipelines have become a regular part of my daily routine and I'm grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional setting.

As a platform developer, I also had the opportunity to work with Azure. I had taken the Azure Fundamentals course prior to joining Telenor, but it's been a different experience working hands-on with Azure. I've been able to learn more about Azure, its capabilities, and how to work with it effectively. I've been learning more about Azure Terraform modules, networking, and the journey of an enterprise adopting the cloud.

Telenor has high ambitions when it comes to the public cloud adoption and enabling developers to deliver better products, faster and it's been great to be a part of this journey.

In conclusion, my experience at Telenor has been fantastic. I've learned so much, had the opportunity to apply my skills, and have been a part of an exciting journey as the company moves towards the cloud. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had at Telenor and look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a platform developer.
