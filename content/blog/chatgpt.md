# My Experience with ChatGPT - A Cool Tool with Limitations

I've been using ChatGPT for a variety of purposes over the past few months, including frontend development, Vue, and even for some random subjects. It's a cool tool, but it's not a silver bullet.

One of the things I've noticed about ChatGPT is that it works better when you have a good understanding of the subject. For example, I've been mostly impressed with the tool when using it for planning ideas related to business startups, character development, and website creation. On the other hand, I've been disappointed when working with code such as Vue and Terraform, mainly because the information provided is often outdated and doesn't work with today's technology.

However, I've found that combining ChatGPT with other resources, such as documentation and Google, has made me much more effective. When used properly, ChatGPT can provide helpful information that complements other resources, allowing me to be more productive.

I've also used ChatGPT for debugging and writing applications. It's been a helpful tool in these situations, allowing me to quickly find solutions to problems and get my work done faster.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It's a tool that can help me get where I want to go faster, and that's all I really need. While it has its limitations, it's still a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their skills and be more productive.
