### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible which is provided by frontend mentor. Any tools you like could be used to help complete the challenge. I wished to practice my typescript skills using nuxt, a vuejs framework. The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, one could also try doing this without JS.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwindcss

### What I learned

This project was to brush up my css, learn more Tailwindcss and estimate timing of projects. Project take longer to finished than anticipated, but I was quite faster than usual

### Continued development

I have to weigh in on whats better to use Tailwindcss or Scss.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Use Utilities](https://vueuse.org/) - This helped me for toggling the menu and media queries easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
