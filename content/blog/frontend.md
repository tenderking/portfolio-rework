I've been working with Frontend Mentor for a few months now and it has been a great experience for me as a frontend developer. It's been a great way to work hands-on with frontend development and improve my skills.
<br/><br/>
One of the best things about Frontend Mentor is the community of developers on the slack channel. This has been a great way to connect with other developers from around the world and get help with any issues I've encountered while working on the challenges. The community is very friendly and helpful, making it a great place to network and learn from others.
<br/><br/>
In addition to the community, Frontend Mentor also offers pair programming. This has been a great way to collaborate with other developers and learn from each other. It's been a great way to gain new perspectives on frontend development and improve my skills.
<br/><br/>
Another great aspect of Frontend Mentor is the opportunity to deploy live sites. This has been a great way to showcase my skills and see my work live on the internet. It's also a great way to share my work with others and get feedback.
<br/><br/>
Finally, Frontend Mentor is also very focused on accessibility. This has been a great way to learn about accessibility and how to make sure my sites are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. This is an important aspect of frontend development and I'm grateful to have learned more about it through Frontend Mentor.
