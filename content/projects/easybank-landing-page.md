## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwindcss

### What I learned

This project was to brush up my css, learn more Tailwindcss and estimate timing of projects. Project take longer to finished than anticipated, but I was quite faster than usual

### Continued development

I have to weigh in on whats better to use Tailwindcss or Scss.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Use Utilities](https://vueuse.org/) - This helped me for toggling the menu and media queries easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Vue Setup

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
